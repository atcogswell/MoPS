R Script generated by Andrew Cogswell (and others) for the DFO Maritimes Region Monitoring Programs (AZMP/BBMP/AZOMP).

These R scripts are used for a number of functions for the programs, like script that generates regularly updated plots for the Bedford Basin Monitoring Program (BBMP) website (http://www.bio.gc.ca/science/monitoring-monitorage/bbmp-pobb/bbmp-pobb-en.php) and script to generate mission plans.
